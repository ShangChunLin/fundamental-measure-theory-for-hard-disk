# hard_disk_fundamental_measure_theory

Free minimizing free energy for one  hard disk triangular unitcell.

A simple code for how to minimizing free energy with designed functionals in Fourier space.

Functionals derived by R.Roth et.al (Roth, Roland, Klaus Mecke, and Martin Oettel. "Communication: Fundamental measure theory for hard disks: Fluid and solid." (2012): 081101.)  

For GPU speedup , see "Massively parallel GPU-accelerated minimization of classical density functional theory"

For more efficient alorigth , search "discrete inversion in iterative subspace"

For crystal-fluid properties of mixture, one can check my work "Phase diagrams and crystal–fluid surface tensions in additive and nonadditive two–dimensional hard disk mixtures" (
